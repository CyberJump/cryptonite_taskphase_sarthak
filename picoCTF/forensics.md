# FORENSICS

# Trivial Flag Transfer Protocol

So When we open the challenge we are given with a PCAPNG file.
so searched up whats a pcapng file and found out its packet capture file and we can analyse it using wireshark

so well i opened the file in wireshark and damn i couldnt understand anything. i mean thats pretty obvious because i havent ever used wireshark. so pulled up youtube and learnt about how to analyse a pcap file in wireshark

this is how the capture file looked like in wireshark

The video I referred to understand this-

It was a great video, and I understood how to use statics section of wireshark.

well ya, i think this was a wrong tangent because i was stuck here for like an hour figuring out what to do next.\
so I was like i need to try to extract the files that were transferred here and luckily for me the same youtuber had the video to extract file from a PCAP file next in his playlist :)\

so then i followed the tutorial and got the files that were transferred.

okkk so i exported the files to a folder and access them.\
There was 1)Instruction.txt file which was a txt file containing a string of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;letters\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2)Plan file which i opened with notepad to find a string of letters\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3)Program.deb file which i didnt know what it was\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Three BMP file pictures and well from the BMP i got it this &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;picture contains something hidden.

well i was kinda stuck here, but then imma come clean and admit i used GPT to identify which kind of encryption was used in txt files (that are instruction.txt and plan file).

well atleast i found out that its ROT13 so i used a online decoder to find the decoded content of first file-

The decoded text didnt make sense at first but then I spaced out the words and I got this- TFTP DOESNT ENCRYPT OUR TRAFFIC SO WE MUST DISGUISE OUR FLAG TRANSFER. FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HIDE THE FLAG AND I WILL CHECK BACK FOR THE PLAN\
Which well first tells that the TFTP isnt safe and also that i should decrypt the plan file.

I did the same thing for the plan file too and got-
I USED THE PROGRAM AND HID IT WITH-DUEDILIGENCE.CHECK OUT THE PHOTOS

so now i used my Ubuntu WSL to install the .deb file and got that they used Steghide to hide the flag in the pictures.

Ahhhhh now i had to learn how to use another software. T_T\
This challenge is testing me hard.

Well i tried to install it and got into some problem but worked past it using a youtube video to define the steghide file folder as PATH in windows so that i can use it as a variable in cmd prompt.\

I opened CMD prompt and ran the steghide command to extract data from the image. Even though i knew that steghide needs a paraphrase to first hide it and also that is used to decode it.\
After pondering upon it i read the decrypted text from PLAN file and bam i got it the paraphrase was DUEDILIGENCE

Then i entered the paraphrase and voila a flag.txt file was downloaded on my system.

Yess finally i got it and i opened to the text file to get the flag that was- picoCTF{h1dd3n_1n_pLa1n_51GHT_18375919}

Wooooow that was a long and strenuos chall to first understand wireshark and then steghide.

BUT at the end the flag gave me the adrenaline rush required ðŸ¤
