# WEB EXPLOITATION

This will deals with all the challenges and resources which i have used to clear the ctfs related to WEB EXPLOITATION.
# 1) Cookies
So this challenge is rated easy in web exploitation part of picoCTF.A link to the website from which we have to extract flag is given.

so when we first open the website we are given a search bar and lightly written snickerdoodle in the text bar.

soo my first thought process was obviously write snickerdoodle in it and see what happens.so when i wrote snickerdoodle in it,I was redirected to the next page which was saying "I love snickerdoodle cookies".I noticed a change in the url of website with an additional /check was added.

I honestly didnt know whats snickerdoodle is so searched up google for whats snicker doodle and found out its a type of cookie.This struck something in my head but before i went back to home page tried inspecting page for the cookies present.
Indeed, there was a cookies with a value -1.

so i was curious again, so what i did was i typed in snickerdoodle again and checked the cookie again and there was a change in value of cookies. it went from -1 to 0.

Well then i searched up all the types of cookies on google. then i got some results.-

From this website i tried butter cookie on the search bar on home page and i observed the cookies again.

This means for each cookie type,there was a particular value of cookie.Now here i went on a tangent. I got it that by changing the value of cookie we can get flag but i didnt wanna bruteforce it.I tried to make a python script which will automate it.

so i searched web to find a way to make a python script to change cookie value and the websites i used were-
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27644296/python-setting-cookie-into-another-website

https://dhruvadave5297.medium.com/how-i-use-python-to-collect-cookies-urls-and-other-data-from-any-website-6ee97f4cafc9

Just from viewing these websites i thought that these are kinda tricky to implement. So i kept this approach as plan b and went for bruteforce first.

I typed in snickerdoodle and change the cookie value from 0 to 1 then refreshed the website and saw that it went from i love snickerdoodle to i love chocolate chip cookies.

well then i just went on a bruteforce spree and by changing the cookies value one by one. It took me 4-5 min of bruteforcing but then i got to picoctf cookie which had the value 18.
